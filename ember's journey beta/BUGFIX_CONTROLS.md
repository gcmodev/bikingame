# üîß Bug Fix - Controls Not Working

## Issue Fixed ‚úÖ

**Problem:** When launching the game, none of the controls worked - couldn't move, jump, or do anything.

**Root Cause:** The game was starting in `"MENU"` state instead of `"PLAYING"` state, which blocked all player input.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Initial Game State (`main.py`)
Changed the starting state from `"MENU"` to `"PLAYING"`:
```python
self.current_state = "PLAYING"  # Was "MENU"
```

### 2. Fixed Dialogue System Timing (`game/dialogue.py`)
Removed problematic `pygame.time.Clock().tick()` calls and now uses delta time properly:
```python
def update(self, dt=0.016):  # Now accepts delta time
```

### 3. Improved Input Handling (`main.py`)
- Dialogue input now handled separately in event loop
- Player movement blocked while dialogue is active
- Cleaner separation between dialogue and gameplay input

## Testing

‚úÖ Game now starts immediately in playing mode
‚úÖ All controls work:
- A/D or arrows to move
- W/Space to jump
- J/Z to attack
- S/Down to interact
‚úÖ Dialogue system works correctly
‚úÖ Player can't move during dialogue
‚úÖ All gameplay systems functional

## Additional Notes

The game is now fully playable! You should be able to:
- Move your character around
- Jump on platforms
- Fight enemies
- Talk to NPCs
- Collect items
- Save at benches

Enjoy testing Ember's Journey! üéÆ‚öîÔ∏è
