I've created a full menu system for Ember's Journey with a pixelated aesthetic!

### ✅ Features Implemented

#### **Main Menu**
- Beautiful title screen with "EMBER'S JOURNEY"
- Subtitle: "A Dark Medieval Adventure"
- Three options:
  - **Start Game** - Begin new adventure
  - **Settings** - (Placeholder for future)
  - **Quit** - Exit game

#### **Pause Menu** (Press ESC during gameplay)
- Semi-transparent overlay
- Four options:
  - **Resume** - Continue playing
  - **Restart** - Restart current level
  - **Main Menu** - Return to main menu
  - **Quit** - Exit game

#### **Visual Effects**
- ✨ Pulsing title animation
- ✨ Animated selector arrow
- ✨ Color-coded selections (cyan for selected)
- ✨ Text shadows for depth
- ✨ Dark atmospheric background

### 🎮 Controls

- **SPACE** or **ENTER** - Select option
- **ESC** - (Not used in main menu)

#### Pause Menu

- **SPACE** or **ENTER** - Select option
- **ESC** - Resume game (close pause menu)

#### During Gameplay
- **ESC** - Open pause menu

### 🎨 Font System

The menu supports **custom pixel fonts**!

#### Default Mode (Current)
- Uses Pygame's built-in font
- Already pixelated and readable
- Works immediately, no setup needed

#### Custom Font Mode
To use a Minecraft-style font:

1. Download **Press Start 2P** font:
   - Visit: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P
   - Click "Download family"
   - Extract the ZIP

2. Install in game:
   - Find `PressStart2P-Regular.ttf`
   - Copy to `assets/fonts/`
   - Rename to `pixel.ttf`

3. Restart game - menu will use custom font!

See `assets/fonts/FONT_GUIDE.md` for more font options.
