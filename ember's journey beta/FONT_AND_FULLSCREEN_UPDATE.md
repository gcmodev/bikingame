# ✅ Font Size & Fullscreen Support Added!

## What's Been Fixed

### 🎨 **Font Sizes Adjusted**

The pixel font was way too big! I've reduced all sizes:

**Before:**
- Title: 32pt (HUGE, cut off screen)
- Menu: 16pt (Too big)
- Small: 12pt (Too big)

**After:**
- Title: 18pt ✅ (Fits perfectly!)
- Menu: 10pt ✅ (Clean and readable)
- Small: 8pt ✅ (Perfect for hints)

### 🖥️ **Fullscreen Support Added**

Press **F11** anytime to toggle fullscreen!

**Features:**
- ✅ F11 toggles fullscreen on/off
- ✅ Works in menu and during gameplay
- ✅ Proper aspect ratio (no stretching)
- ✅ Black bars on sides if needed
- ✅ Centered on screen

## 📐 How Fullscreen Works

### Windowed Mode (Default)
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│   1280 x 720        │
│   Game fills window │
└─────────────────────┘
```

### Fullscreen Mode (F11)
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  Black │  Game Area  │  Black  │
│  Bar   │  (scaled)   │  Bar    │
│        │  1920x1080  │         │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
          Centered, proper aspect ratio
```

The game maintains its 16:9 aspect ratio and centers itself, adding black bars if your monitor isn't exactly 16:9.
